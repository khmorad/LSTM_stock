# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM and Linear Regression

Predict stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Linear Regression models.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict stock prices using two different machine learning models: LSTM and Linear Regression. Stock price prediction is a common application of time series analysis, and this project provides a hands-on example of using different algorithms to make predictions.

## Features

- Stock price prediction using LSTM and Linear Regression models.
- Data visualization with matplotlib for better understanding.
- Integration with pandas for data manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khmorad/LSTM_stock.git
